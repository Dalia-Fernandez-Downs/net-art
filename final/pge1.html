<div class="textboxnormal"><p><b>Carl:</b> We waited until he was five before we started thinking about other kids. By this point he had started kindergarten,  and his screaming fits stopped  and were replaced with what I can only describe as angst. He was worried, constantly. His brain seemed like it was always  humming.

<p><b>DeAnna:</b> I didn't really expect to become pregnant, but the vomiting started one morning and I just knew.

<p><b>Carl:</b> Neither of us expected twins.
