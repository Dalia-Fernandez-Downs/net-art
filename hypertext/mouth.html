<p>I’m standing in front of the mouth of the commission. The building looks like a big concrete puzzle box, slided in between slabs of rock. There’s little hexagonal patterns on the bricks, big bricks all in a grid, sticking out at various degrees. It’s all stained with age. The entrance has been busted open. Only one door is left in the doorway, the other laying flat along the ground in front of the mouth, sort of half covered in dirt and leaves. <a href=lobby.html>inside</a> it’s dark.
