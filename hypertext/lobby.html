<p>It smells like mildew and running water inside of the commission. There’s cold air coming in from <a href=mouth.html>outside</a>. There’s a few benches, and the walls are covered in faded graffiti. The walls used to have posters and things but they’re not there anymore. There’s some metal ribbing where glass walls and doors would have been, <a href=office.html>tucked away</a> in a corner at one end of the room and in a more complicated style at the center, leading into a <a href=hallway1.html>long hallway</a>. The glass that the ribbing would have held in place is in little pieces all over the ground.
