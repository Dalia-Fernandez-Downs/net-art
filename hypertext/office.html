<p>It’s an office, I think. I remember waiting in here as a kid. It’s trashed now. The desks are thrown about. There’s a pile of shit in the corner with one of those shiny blue tarps over it, but it’s hard to tell. Someone might be sleeping under there, which means it’s <a href=lobby.html>time to leave</a>.
