<P class="specialtext"><b>Judy Marcus, kindergarten teacher:</b> Ammon's apocalyptic preoccupations were present in so much of his schoolwork. The drawings were the worst. They were everywhere, even in the margins of his alphabet worksheets. I had students complain that I didn't assign enough art that year, and I think it was because I was afraid to. It wasn't the content — angels, flames, things like that — so much as the way they were drawn. Lines scribbled in hard. Explosions of color. Kindergarteners will oftentimes fill a whole piece of paper with one color, but when Ammon did it, and I know this sounds insane, but believe me, it felt hellish.</P>
