<P><b>Carl:</b> It started with him asking what happens after you die. That's a very normal question for a kid to have at that age, so I didn't think much of it. By this time he was attending services with us, so I felt it was appropriate to explain what we believe about the afterlife, heaven, all those things. Of course that included the return. I tried to make it sound gentler for him.</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> I wanted to  be the one to have that conversation.   I don't think Carl ever understood how to talk to him.</p>
