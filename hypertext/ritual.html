    This room is hardly bigger than a closet. There’s a little platform with lit candles and a small figurine, something I vaguely recognize as one of the more obscure deities. I can’t remember its name. It’s strange that the candles are still lit. <a href=hallway2.html>I don’t want to stay here</a> very long anymore.
