    Down the stairs is another hallway. It looks very similar to the one <a href=hallway1.html>upstairs</a>, but it feels strangely warm down here. All of the doors on the sides of the hallway are locked, but at the other end of the room is a little narrow alcove with three doors, <a href=machine.html>red</a>, <a href=ritual.html>yellow</a>, <a href=cave.html>blue</a>. Iâ€™ve never been down here. It feels strangely alive, like they never shut it down.
