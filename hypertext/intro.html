<p>The walk up to the commission is kind of pretty. Sometimes you can’t tell the highway is almost right next to you, because the foliage is pretty thick. It’s annoying getting there when it’s this late though, everything blends together in the darkness. It’s safer than going during the day at least. It’s also quiet. I see it in the distance, barely visible behind the turn in the road, but it’s growing now as it comes into <a href=mouth.html>full view</a>.
