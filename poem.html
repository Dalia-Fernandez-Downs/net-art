<h1>Excerpt from <em>Ammon</em>, by Maggie Siebert </h1>
<hr>
<p><b>Carl:</b> <ul><li>We waited until he was five before we started thinking about other kids.</li> 
<li>By this point he had started kindergarten, &nbsp;and his screaming fits stopped &nbsp;and were replaced with what I can only describe as angst.</li> <li>He was worried, constantly. His brain seemed like it was always &nbsp;humming. 
</p></li></ul>
</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> I didn't really expect to become pregnant, but the vomiting started one morning and I just knew.
</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> Neither of us expected twins.
</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> Id catch him looking at my stomach all the time. He'd ask me <a href="https://www.google.com/" target=”blank”>if the babies were going to be okay</a>. It started making me nervous &nbsp;that he might know something I didn't.
</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> He kept asking if <a href="https://www.google.com/" target=”blank”>his brother and sister could breathe in there</a>.
</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> It wasn't just them he was worried about, though. He had an obsession with the end of the world.
</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> It started with him asking <a href="https://www.google.com/" target=”blank”>what happens after you die</a>. That's a very normal question for a kid to have at that age, so I didn't think much of it. <br>By this time he was attending services with us, so I felt it was appropriate to explain what we believe about the afterlife, heaven, all those things. <br>Of course that included the return. I tried to make it sound gentler for him.
</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> I wanted to &nbsp; be the one to have that conversation. &nbsp; I don't think Carl ever understood how to talk to him.
</p>
<p><b>Judy Marcus, kindergarten teacher:</b> Ammon's apocalyptic preoccupations were present in so much of his schoolwork. <br>The drawings were the worst. They were everywhere, even in the margins of his alphabet worksheets. I had students complain that I didn't assign enough art that year, and I think it was because I was afraid to. <ol><li>It wasn't the content — </li> <li>angels, flames, things like that —</li> <li>so</li> <li>much</li> <li>as</li> <li>the</li> <li>way</li> <li>they</li> <li>were</li> <li>drawn.</li> </ol> Lines scribbled in hard. <br>Explosions of color. <br>Kindergarteners will oftentimes fill a whole piece of paper with one color, but when Ammon did it, and I know this sounds insane, but believe me, it felt hellish.
</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> I never wanted this for him.
</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> No amount of explaining made it less frightening for him.
</p>
<p><b>DeAnna:</b> I never wanted this for me.
</p>
<p><b>Judy:</b> I just don't understand why a five-year-old should have to reckon with that kind of thing.
</p>
<p><b>Carl:</b> Maybe he was too young. I tried to tell him it was a beautiful thing, that it's the greatest and most perfect thing that could happen to us, and that when it happened he wouldn't be worried or scared.
</p>
<p><b>Judy:</b> Frankly I think it's child abuse.
